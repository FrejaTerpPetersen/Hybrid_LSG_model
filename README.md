# Hybrid_LF-GP_model
Python program for EOF analysis of MIKE 21 data to enable training of Sparse Gaussian Process (SPGP / Sparse GP) models to predict flood inundation extent. 

The model is developed for the publication: "Modelling dynamic flood inundation using a hybrid low-fidelity and Sparse Gaussian Process model" and uses the Chowilla floodplain as case study. 

MIKE 21 result files needed to run the code are available at XX.
